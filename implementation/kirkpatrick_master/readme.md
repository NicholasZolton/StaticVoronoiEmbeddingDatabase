## Documentation

For extensive documentation, please see the doc/ directory in this folder.  Open index.html in your browser.

There is also quite a bit of inline documentation in each method explaining different steps.

## Demonstration

See the demonstration in the html documentation, or interactively with Kirkpatrick Demo.ipynb.  For even more examples,
you can look at Testing.ipynb, although it isn't as carefully formatted.
